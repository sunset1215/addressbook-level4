The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

### Logic component

```
###### \DeveloperGuide.md
``` md
The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the TaskBook data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have)  - `* *`,  Low (unlikely to have) - `*`

Priority | As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can...
-------- | :-------- | :--------- | :-----------
`* * *` | new user | see usage instructions | refer to instructions when I forget how to use the App
`* * *` | user | add a task by specifying a task description only | record tasks that needs to be done ‘some day’
`* * *` | user | add a task by specifying a task description and date | record tasks that needs to be done by the specified date
`* * *` | user | add a task by specifying a task description, start date and end date | record tasks that spans the specified dates
`* * *` | user | delete a task | get rid of tasks that I no longer care to track. 
`* * *` | user | edit a task | update the details of that specific task
`* * *` | user | search my tasks | find an item that I’m looking for in an easier manner
`* *` | user | list tasks | see what tasks I have to complete or have already completed
`* *` | user | undo the last command | go back to the previous state
`* *` | user | specify storage location | choose where to store the data
`* *` | user | mark tasks as complete | track tasks that have already been done
`* *` | user | sort my tasks | organize my tasks in some way
`* *` | user | use shorter versions of a command | type a command faster
`*` | user | tag my tasks based on priority | prioritize my goals
`*` | user | assign my tasks to a project or category | organize my tasks in an orderly manner

> * Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
    e.g. `meeting` will match `meeting with John`

Examples: 
* `find Highlight`<br>
  Returns any tasks having names `Highlight` or `highlight`
* `find product highlight showcase`<br>
