The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the TaskBook data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
* maintains an `UndoTaskStack` that keeps track of each action that the user performs

### Any.do

**Strengths**<br>

1. Simple UI for creating tasks -- simply swipe down to create a new task
2. Voice dictation for adding tasks
3. Swipe gestures for marking completed tasks
4. Allows users to add notes/subtasks to a reminder
5. Can share and assign tasks/reminders to different friends/emails
6. Group tasks by different lists

**Weaknesses**<br>

1. Simple UI does not allow setting of due date/time when creating tasks
2. Basic task like having repeating tasks is a premium service to pay for $2/month
3. Limiting location based reminders is also as a premium service to pay for $2/month

### Our SuperTasker App
Given the strengths and weaknesses of these apps that we've surveyed, our app solves several of these issues:

**Strengths**<br>

1. Easy way to search events and tasks
2. Intuitive natural language processor that parses CLI for identifying due date/time
3. Not owned by a company, so it's open source and free
4. Able to display all tasks at once
5. Maintains a very simple process for adding and editing tasks

**Weaknesses**<br>

1. UI does not allow for customization, only provides minimal support
2. Lacking support for sub tasks
3. Lacking support for recurring tasks

## FAQ
**Q**: Can I run this on my Mac? <br>
**A**: Currently the application does function on Mac operating systems. However, because SuperTasker is intended for Windows machines, there are minor issues with the storage command. The storage file path standards for Windows differs from the file path on Mac, so you will manually need to update your storage path via the CLI instead of the GUI window explorer. 

**Q**: Can I open my tasks on another computer? <br>
**A**: To move your saved tasks to another computer, simply move the `taskbook.xml` file from your storage location to another new computer. From the new computer, run supertasker.jar and change the storage path to reference your copied `taskbook.xml`.

**Q**: Can I contribute to this project? <br>
**A**: Of course! This project is entirely open source and we welcome pull requests. Follow the process described [here](https://github.com/oss-generic/process)
